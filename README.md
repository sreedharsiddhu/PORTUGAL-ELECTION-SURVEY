# PORTUGAL-ELECTION-SURVEY 2019
This repository hosts an extensive machine learning project that delves into the analysis of the 2019 legislative election results in Portugal. This project was a key component of the final assessment for a Machine Learning course, and it showcases the application of a variety of machine learning regression techniques to predict electoral outcomes based on real-time data.

Dataset Overview The dataset, which is a crucial part of this project, was obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It encompasses detailed, real-time data from the 2019 legislative elections in Portugal. This rich dataset includes over 10,000 data points and 30 different attributes. These attributes range from the number of votes received by each party and the mandates allocated, to geographical and territorial information related to the elections. The dataset is publicly accessible and can be found at the UCI Machine Learning Repository's website.

Project Framework The project is meticulously structured into several key phases:

Data Preprocessing: This initial stage involves cleaning the dataset and preparing it for subsequent analysis. It ensures the data quality and consistency needed for accurate model training and analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): In this phase, both univariate and multivariate analyses are conducted. The aim is to identify trends, patterns, and correlations within the data that could be significant for the prediction models.

Feature Engineering: This critical step involves identifying and selecting the most impactful features that have a significant influence on the election mandates.

Model Development: This phase entails the construction and training of six distinct regression models, each with its unique approach to predicting election outcomes.

Model Evaluation: The models are rigorously evaluated and compared using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared values to determine their performance and accuracy.

Conclusions: The final stage where insights and conclusions are drawn based on the performance and outcomes of the evaluated models.

Evaluated Models The project evaluates a diverse array of machine learning models, including:

Linear Regression Decision Tree Regressor K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Gradient Boosting Regressor Support Vector Machine (SVM) Random Forest Regressor Project Findings The analysis revealed that the Decision Tree and Random Forest Regressor models exhibited superior performance, achieving near-perfect prediction scores. Conversely, the SVM model showed less promising results, indicating a potential need for further parameter optimization and model refinement.
